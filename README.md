My cool and awesome Adventure game

# About
This is a command line game I started making in high-school and never got the chance to finish. It was my first exposure to the java programming language. I 
learned a lot while making the game. My only regret is not seeing the game through and making it beatable. Hopefully when I get some free time 
I'll add the last few levels and make it possible to beat the game.
